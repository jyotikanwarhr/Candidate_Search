  ## Description
The Candidate Search Application is a dynamic React project built with TypeScript that enables employers to efficiently explore and evaluate candidate profiles using data from the GitHub API. It utilizes a custom API endpoint to fetch user information, showcasing key details such as name, username, location, avatar, email, bio, and company affiliation. Employers can conveniently add promising candidates to a saved list with the "+" button, skip profiles using the "-" button, and access a persistent view of accepted profiles. To further enhance the hiring workflow, optional features like sorting and filtering may also be introduced.
